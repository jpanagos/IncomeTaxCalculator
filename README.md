# IncomeTaxCalculator
Project for the Software Development II (MYE004) course (Spring 2016).
Development of 4 subsystems (GUI interface, Input datasystem, Visualizations datasystem, Datamanaging subsystem).

The project is divided into two phases:
# Phase 1
* First implementation.
* Only functionality is important.

# Phase 2
* Full utilization of factory methods.
* Refactoring of phase 1.
* Rules of refactoring:
  * Maximum method length of 10 lines.
  * Maximum file length of 200 lines.
  * Maximum number of 2 parameters per method.
  * No switch cases, no nested if or if-else commands, no nested loops and should adhere to Demeter's Law.
* The above rules apply to all subsystems except the GUI (Bonus points if applied).
